# Todo List Application

Welcome to my first React project on GitHub! This project is a simple yet fully functional Todo List application. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in front-end development using React and related technologies.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Todos**: Manage your tasks efficiently with easy-to-use functionalities.
- **Persistent Data**: Uses `json-server` to simulate a backend, ensuring your tasks are saved between sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with CSS to provide a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Key UI elements are modularized into separate JSX files and imported as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript (JS)**: Core language for application logic.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for faster and leaner development.
- **React Hooks**:
  - **useState**: For state management within functional components.
  - **useEffect**: For handling side effects such as data fetching and DOM manipulation.
  - **useRef**: For accessing and interacting with DOM elements directly.

## Project Structure

- **App.jsx**: Main component that orchestrates the application.
- **TodoList.jsx**: Component responsible for rendering the list of todos.
- **TodoItem.jsx**: Component for individual todo items.
- **AddTodoForm.jsx**: Form component for adding new todos.
